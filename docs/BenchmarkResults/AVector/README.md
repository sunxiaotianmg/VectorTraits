([← Back](../README.md))

## Benchmark results of Vector (向量的基准测试结果)

- [Multiply](Multiply.md): Multiplies two vectors to compute their element-wise product (将两个向量相乘来计算它们的积).
- [Narrow](Narrow.md): Narrows two Vector instances into one Vector  (将两个 Vector 实例缩窄为一个 Vector ).
- [Widen](Widen.md): Widens a Vector into two Vector instances (将一个 Vector 扩宽为两个 Vector 实例).
- [YClamp](YClamp.md): Computes the numerical clamp of each element in a vector (计算向量中每个元素的数值限制)
- [YNarrowSaturate](YNarrowSaturate.md): Saturate narrows two Vector instances into one Vector  (将两个 Vector 实例饱和缩窄为一个 Vector ).
- [YNarrowSaturateUnsigned](YNarrowSaturateUnsigned.md): Saturate narrows two signed Vector instances into one unsigned Vector  (将两个有符号 Vector 实例饱和缩窄为一个无符号 Vector ).
